# Contributing to EngageSense

We love your input! We want to make contributing to EngageSense as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the documentation with any new dependencies
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers
